		<hr>

		<p> In this webpage, I will be discussing my music opinions with artist inclusing JAY-Z, Kendrick Lamar, Tyler, the Creator, Kanye West, etc. Reminder that these are my opinions and if they do strike you in a dissagreeing way, they are just my opinions. These opinions consist of albums, singles, lyricism, and producing. </p>

		<p> Now the definition of Rap and Hip-hop music is said in Britannica, "Rap, musical style in which rhythmic and/or rhyming speech is chanted to musical accompaniment...". Throughout the centuries, music has played a big role in it, with in the 1990s, with rap, hip-hop, etc. </p>

		<h3> My Hot Takes </h3>

			<ul type="disc">
				<li> Kanye West's newest album <strong> "VULTURES 2" </strong> with Ty Dolla $ign was underwhemling when it released. <strong> "VULTURES" </strong> was some-what better than the sequel. With "FRIED" and "FIELD TRIP" the only good songs with lyrism and producment, with Kanye's and Ty's vocals. </li>
			</ul>

			<ul type="disc">
				<li> JPEGMafia's latest album <strong> "I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU" </strong> was recently released in the past months. This album is becoming one of JPEGMafia's killer hits with "LP!" and "EP!" beside it. The reason why this is in my hot-takes is because some people aren't really fond with his style of music in this particular album. </li>
			</ul>

			<ul type="disc">
				<li> JAY-Z's studio album "4:44" was praised by the audience and the crowd but for me, it was kind of underwhelming to say the least. Some songs on the album are great to listen to and have good lyricism and story-telling, example "The Story of OJ" but some songs are underwhelming and are just sung like a lullaby. JAY-Z's way of rhyming words and lyrics don't really sound great to me. </li> 
			</ul>
